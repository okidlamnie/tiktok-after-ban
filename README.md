Step 1: Check your device's app store

Here's how to download the APK file:

Open your web browser and search for "TikTok APK."
Choose a trusted source to download the APK file from, such as APKMirror or APKPure.
Download the APK file to your device.
Step 3: Install the APK file (for Android users)

Once you have downloaded the APK file, follow these steps to install it on your device:

Open your device's settings and go to "Security" or "Privacy."
Enable the option that allows the installation of apps from unknown sources.
Locate the downloaded APK file in your device's "Downloads" folder.
